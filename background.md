## Project background

[Josh] Still chewing over ideas, but Iâ€™d be interested in doing something related to games. If anybody else would be interested in that path let me know! We can figure something achievable together. I think this would be a good place to start: https://mud.dev/what-is-mud

[Andrew] Hi Josh, I was thinking along similar lines. Possible directions:
Wordle in Noir
Something simpler (e.g. a daily maths challenge `(14 _ 11 _ 14 _ 5 = 355` - fill in the operators); perhaps some incentive for the person who causes the next puzzle to be generated
On-chain problem solver, e.g. Advent of Code https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1
Some other puzzle that hasn't been done yet

[Josh] Yeah that sounds good, I see somebody has already made Wordle for Noir. https://github.com/ruizehung/Zero-Knowledge-Sudoku-Wordle-Trivia Maybe something like this? https://nerdlegame.com/
